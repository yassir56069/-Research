- [ ] Try out docker on some projects (Golang and .NET project).
- [ ] Make a simple Golang web service and see how far vanilla goes.
- [ ] Try out rust and learn to use it, make a small personal note taker app.

## Stuff to think about

I should possibly figure out a more consistent workflow for documenting things which reduces the writing and organizing to be more streamlined. Right now I'm just trying this out and seeing how things go. I want this to be as smooth as possible. if somehow I coul set this up to work directly with a note-taking utility much like Notepad++ (Obsidian perhaps?) it could simplify the process instead of having vscode open for the purposes of noting things down.

All That being said, this doesn't go against my current workflow. it's also not too hard to just make a "research.md" file in my new project repos and set it up to document the things I do for that project. I don't think there's much to be lost by doing it this way anyhow. At most I want this to be as simple as possible whilst remaining as accessible as possible. Github is 100% a must for this as well. I want to keep markdown for reliability and accessibility in various formats. also simpler to quickly write into neatly.

I should also look into some nicer stats formatting for some of these things, I'm unfamilliar with alot of the quirks of markdown. so far so good though. perhaps this'll also make me faster at typing since I'll be writing more than usual.

## 18 Dec 2024

I've made some changes to how I take notes now. with all this setting up done, now I really have a place to note down my thoughts and figure things out. for a while I'll probably just use this to rapidly take notes and not worry too much about it. it is however incredibly pleasant to have something this nice to take notes in
